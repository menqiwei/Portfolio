This project was developed as part of a teaching assignment to introduce students to the fundamentals of missing data analysis. It covers key concepts such as types of missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), techniques for visualizing missing data patterns, and common imputation methods.

This project explores BMW used car prices through EDA and predictive modeling. Linear regression and random forest regression were used to estimate prices based on vehicle features, with model performance evaluated and compared.

This project involved building and comparing two classification models to predict a binary outcome using a structured dataset. Key tasks included data preparation, feature engineering, and model evaluation based on AUC.

This project uses animated visualizations to explore global trends in key socio-economic indicators over time, including population, GDP, GDP per capita, and life expectancy. Built with the Gapminder dataset, it reveals how countries have evolved across multiple dimensions of development.

This project analyzes student behavior in online learning environments using clickstream data from the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was applied to identify key behavioral factors that influence student performance. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was then used to classify students into performance categories.

This project uses ChatGPT-4o to summarize news articles and detect media bias across the political spectrum. It evaluates the summaries using BERT scores and information coverage, and analyzes how well bias is preserved or shifted during the summarization process.
